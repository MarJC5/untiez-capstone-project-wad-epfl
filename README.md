rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed (PS: As this is a clone repo, the AWS Key will return an error)
rails server
```

Webpack will load all the stylesheet & javascript at the first run and then auto-update after any change in **app\javascript** folder.


## Front end

All the SCSS is generate by webpack by import the application.scss here -> **app\javascript\packs\application.js**.
The stylesheets structure is inside **app\javascript\stylesheets** folder.

#### JavaScript DOM manipulation

**Rails-UJS**
- Create asych action with AJAX (In the view: Comments submition, like buttons etc...).
The files are inside **app\javascript\ujs** and is import to webpack -> **app\javascript\packs\application.js**.


**JavaScript**
- Manipulate the DOM
Most of the JS used for manipulate the DOM is located here -> **app\javascript\stylesheets\main.js** and import as well in -> **app\javascript\packs\application.js**.


#### CSS frameworks

**[TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) :**

It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

- Powerfull for create rapidly and easily responsive elements in the view. (Forms, Card, Grids)
- Webpack config file: **postcss.config.js**


**Atomic Design Methodology**
- Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner.


**Scss**

- Creation of @mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site
- @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another

```

## Deployment services

The application is deployed with **Heroku**.
- Easy to push the code from GitHub
- perfect match with ruby project

## Issues

**User edit - Password conflict**
```
# test if a given string contains at least a lowercase letter, a uppercase, a digit and 8+ chars
has_secure_password

validates :password, format: { with:  /(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9]).{7,}/, message: I18n.t('user.alert.strong_password') }
```

The validates format for user password force the user to enter the password during each update otherwise it will not validate the change and return the password validation error message.
All admin user cannot update 'registered' info as they don't have the user password.

A Gem like 'Devise' seems more appropriate for manage password users and more.

I have currently remove the validates to avoid the admin update issue.

**Post creation - photoshoot**:
It takes time to upload a picture to S3, I have to found a way to optimize the photo upload rapidity. Or maybe a pro account with more power will help.

**[@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss):**
I had to remove this plugging because in Production some of my SCSS has been desabled altough they were added in the exclusion list.
For now I don't found a solution so I decide to implement it later on.


**[MapBox JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api):**

The map container is displaying, but no street data are displaying in the container

**Error:**

Uncaught ReferenceError: _typeof is not defined

**Fix:**

// Preventing Babel from transpiling NodeModules packages => config\webpack\environment.js

environment.loaders.delete('nodeModules');
